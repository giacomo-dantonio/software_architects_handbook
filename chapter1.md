# Chapter 1 - The meaning of software architecture

- Software architecture consists of early design decisions that can be difficult to change later.
- All software system have an architecture, even without formal design or documentation.

- A software architecture defines a solution that meets requirements.
- A software architecture either enables of inhibts quality attributes
  (maintainability, interoperability, security and performance).
  These are *non-functional* requirements. As opposed to features,
  which are *functional* requirements.
- A software architecture lets you plan and manage change.
  If the requirements change, a change of the architecture is needed,
  otherwise only single elements need to be changed.
  Documentation is important for this, because it tells you how
  the requirements affect the architecture.
- A software architecture improves (cost and effort) estimates.
  The architecture and its documentation will let you plan
  packages of work (either in a top-down or in a bottom-up
  approach) which can be estimated easily.
- Software architecture is not a silver bullet.
- A software architecture should avoid ivory towers:
  * be involved in a number of phases of the software development cycle
  * do some coding
  * leading from the trenches, instead from an ivory tower
  * teach, not preach
  * should not be separated from stakeholder, but also not
    from the technical implementation

- Don't feel overwelmed!
